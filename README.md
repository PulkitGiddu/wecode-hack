## 🎯 Problem Statement & Scope

### Current Challenges

### Proposed Scope
The system delivers an end-to-end digital solution to:
- Search and book meeting rooms based on seating capacity and amenities.
- Manage a dynamic credit economy for managers.
- Provide real-time visibility of room availability and bookings to all employees.
