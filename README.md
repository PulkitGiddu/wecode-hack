**Team Name: 404 Not Found**



## 📌 Executive Summary
The **Automated Meeting Room Booking System**, developed by **Team 404 Not Found**, is a centralized enterprise-grade platform designed to optimize office meeting room utilization. It introduces a **credit-based booking economy** combined with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure fair usage, eliminate scheduling conflicts, and enforce accountability through an automated and professional workflow.

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Scope

### Current Challenges
- **Manual Overhead:** Manual scheduling results in double bookings and operational inefficiencies.
- **Resource Inefficiency:** Premium meeting rooms are frequently misused for small meetings without cost accountability.
- **Lack of Access Control:** No clear separation between administrative configuration, booking authority, and general visibility.

### Proposed Scope
The system delivers an end-to-end digital solution to:
- Search and book meeting rooms based on seating capacity and amenities.
- Manage a dynamic credit economy for managers.
- Provide real-time visibility of room availability and bookings to all employees.

| Manager | Search rooms, book meetings, and spend allocated credits |
| Member  | View-only access to room schedules and booking status |
